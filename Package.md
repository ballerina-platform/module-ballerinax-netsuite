# Introduction

This module allows you to access the NetSuite's SuiteTalk REST Web services API though Ballerina. NetSuite is used for 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and to manage inventory, track their financials, host e-commerce stores, and maintain 
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems. The NetSuite connector can execute CRUD (create, read, update, delete) 
and search operations to perform business processing on NetSuite records and to navigate dynamically between records.

        * Client Secret
3. If you have Client ID, Client Secret from your administrator, Obtain the below credentials by following the token based authorization in the [NetSuite documentation](https://system.na0.netsuite.com/app/help/helpcenter.nl?fid=book_1559132836.html&vid=_BLm3ruuApc_9HXr&chrole=17&ck=9Ie2K7uuApI_9PHO&cktime=175797&promocode=&promocodeaction=overwrite&sj=7bfNB5rzdVQdIKGhDJFE6knJf%3B1590725099%3B165665000).

    Information).

        E.g:  https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.suitetalk.api.netsuite.com


## Quickstart(s)
1. Create a Ballerina file and import the following Netsuite module and the others.
```ballerina
import ballerinax/netsuite;
```
2. Create a NetSuite Client by providing credentials.
```ballerina
public function main() returns error? {
    netsuite:NetsuiteConfiguration nsConfig = {
        accountId: "<accountId>",
        consumerId: "<consumerId>",
        consumerSecret: "<consumerSecret>",
        token: "<token>",
        tokenSecret: "<tokenSecret>",
        baseURL: "<webServiceURL>/services/NetSuitePort_2020_2"
    };
    netsuite:Client netsuiteClient = check new(nsConfig);
```
3. Use remote functions of the connector to create, read, update, and delete records in NetSuite.
```ballerina
    netsuite:RecordInputRef currency = {
        internalId: "1",
        'type: "currency"
    };
    netsuite:NewAccount account = {
        acctNumber: "1234567",
        acctName: "Ballerina NetSuite Demo Account",
        currency: currency
    };
    netsuite:RecordAddResponse|error newAccount = netsuiteClient->addNewAccount(account);
    if (newAccount is netsuite:RecordAddResponse) {
        log:printInfo(output.toString());
    } else {
        log:printError(newAccount.message());
    }
}
```
4. Open an terminal and change directory to where your file is saved and use `bal run <YOUR_BALLERINA_FILE_NAME>.bal` command to run the ballerina file.

## Samples

Instantiate the connector by giving authentication details in the HTTP client config, which has built-in support for 
TBA . NetSuite uses TBA to authenticate and authorize requests. The NetSuite connector can be instantiated 
in the HTTP client config using the client ID, client secret, access token and access token secret. You may use Ballerina [Configuration variable](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/configurable.html) to store your credentials.
